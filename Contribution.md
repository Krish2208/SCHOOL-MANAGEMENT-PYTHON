## Workflow Guidelines

> If you use fork of this project. You may want to refer to the following.

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone the fork on your machine.
3. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in this directory.
4. Type `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Krish2208/SCHOOL-MANAGEMENT-PYTHON.git`. (_This is just a one-time thing_)
5. _Make changes to your code._
6. Run `git fetch upstream master`
7. Then, `git merge upstream/master`
8. For the most part _Step 7_ will automatically merge all the changes from upstream. If it doesn't, it will give you Merge Conflict error wherein you need to manually resolve those conflics. You can use VSCode to resolve any such merge conflics if they exist.
9. Finally, make a pull request from your fork to this Repository.

**PS:** You mostly have to deal with steps 6 through 9 most of the time.
